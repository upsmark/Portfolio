   <h2>Mark's bio</h2>

<blockquote>
   <p>My name is Mark Upson and I believe that design is a law of nature.
     Depending on one's perspective-microscopically or macroscopically-
     inspiration is everywhere.

     My designs originate here, in the universe that surrounds us and
     forms the molecules of our lives. Design in my view is not an adjunct
     topic, or separate from the pursuit of life, but integral and forming
     the DNA of a project.

     Let's discuss the possibilities together. Reach out and contact me.
